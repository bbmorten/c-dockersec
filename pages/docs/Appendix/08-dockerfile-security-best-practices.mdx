# Dockerfile Security Best Practices

Dockerfiles offer several built-in **security features and best practices** to help harden container images. While Dockerfiles themselves are not comprehensive security tools, they allow you to **reduce the attack surface**, enforce **least privilege**, and manage **capabilities and permissions**.

Here's a breakdown of **security-relevant settings and practices** available through Dockerfiles:

---

## 🔐 1. `USER` – Drop Root Privileges

```Dockerfile
USER appuser
```

* **Default user is root**, which is dangerous.
* Always switch to a **non-root user** as early as possible.
* Combine with `groupadd`, `useradd`, or `adduser` to create users inside the container.

---

## 🧱 2. `FROM` – Use Minimal and Trusted Base Images

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20
```

* Prefer **minimal base images** (e.g. `alpine`, `distroless`, `busybox`).
* Use **specific versions** (not `latest`) to avoid unintended changes.
* Pull from **trusted registries** or sign your base images (see Docker Content Trust).

---

## 📂 3. `COPY` / `ADD` – Limit and Sanitize Context

```Dockerfile
COPY ./app /app
```

* Avoid copying unnecessary files (use `.dockerignore`).
* Prefer `COPY` over `ADD` unless you need archive extraction or remote URLs.

---

## 🔧 4. `RUN` – Avoid Shell Injection

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

* Use `&&` instead of multiple `RUN` layers to reduce image size.
* **Never trust user input** in `RUN` commands.
* Pin dependencies and validate checksums if downloading files.

---

## 🛡 5. `HEALTHCHECK` – Monitor Container Health

```Dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

* Helps ensure the container is operating correctly.
* Can trigger automated recovery actions.

---

## 🔒 6. `ENV` – Avoid Leaking Secrets

```Dockerfile
ENV DB_PASSWORD=supersecret  # ❌ Avoid this!
```

* **Never bake secrets into the image**.
* Use runtime secrets injection mechanisms instead (e.g. Docker Secrets, Kubernetes Secrets).

---

## 🪪 7. `LABEL` – Metadata for Security Scanning

```Dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="security@yourorg.com"
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://github.com/your/repo"
```

* Helps with auditability, scanning tools, SBOM (Software Bill of Materials).

---

## 🔍 8. `CMD` / `ENTRYPOINT` – Avoid Shell Wrappers

```Dockerfile
CMD ["./myapp"]
```

* Prefer `exec` form (`JSON array`) over shell form to avoid issues with signal handling and shell injection.

---

## 🔄 9. Multi-Stage Builds – Separate Build/Runtime

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o main .

FROM scratch
COPY --from=build /app/main /main
ENTRYPOINT ["/main"]
```

* Avoid carrying build tools or sensitive data into the final image.

---

## ⛔️ 10. `VOLUME`, `EXPOSE` – Be Explicit (Optional)

```Dockerfile
VOLUME /data
EXPOSE 8080
```

* While not strict security controls, they document intended use and ports, aiding hardening efforts.

---

## ✅ Bonus: Combine with Docker Runtime Hardening

Dockerfile alone isn't enough. Combine with:

* `docker run` flags:

  * `--read-only`
  * `--cap-drop=ALL`
  * `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`
  * `--tmpfs /tmp`
* Tools like:

  * Docker Content Trust (`DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1`)
  * Image scanning tools (Trivy, Docker Scout)
  * Rootless Docker or Podman
  * Seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux profiles
