# Docker Compose File example for Secure Deployment

Here‚Äôs a **hardened `docker-compose.yml`** example that incorporates runtime security best practices such as:

* Dropping all Linux capabilities
* Running as a non-root user
* Read-only filesystem
* No privilege escalation
* Minimal volumes

## üîê Secure `docker-compose.yml` Example

This example assumes you're using a **Node.js app** that listens on port 3000:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  app:
    image: my-secure-node-app:latest
    container_name: secure_app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    user: "1001:1001"  # Match the non-root UID:GID from the Dockerfile
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "--quiet", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
```

## üß™ Optional: With Named Volume (Read-Only)

If your app needs persistent config or static data:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - app-config:/app/config:ro

volumes:
  app-config:
    external: false
```

## üß∞ Tips

| Feature             | Benefit                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read_only: true`   | Ensures no writes to the root filesystem                 |
| `cap_drop: - ALL`   | Removes all Linux capabilities from the container        |
| `no-new-privileges` | Prevents gaining root via setuid binaries                |
| `user: 1001:1001`   | Drops root privileges at runtime                         |
| `tmpfs: /tmp`       | Mounts an ephemeral `/tmp` for runtime-only temp storage |
