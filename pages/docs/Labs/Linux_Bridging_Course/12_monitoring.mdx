# 🧠 Lesson 12: Monitoring Bridge Traffic

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Monitor live traffic flowing through a Linux bridge
- Use system tools to capture and analyze packets
- Understand bridge forwarding behavior with the FDB (Forwarding Database)

---

## 📡 Why Monitor Bridge Traffic?

Monitoring helps you:

- Debug connectivity issues
- Detect suspicious activity
- Confirm that VLAN and STP configs are working

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Monitor Bridge Interfaces

### Prerequisite: A Linux bridge `br0` with connected interfaces or containers

---

## 🔍 Tool 1: `tcpdump`

Capture and inspect packets on the bridge interface:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i br0 -nn -e
```

> `-e` shows Ethernet headers including MAC addresses

Capture only ARP packets:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i br0 arp
```

Filter by VLAN tag:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i br0 vlan
```

---

## 📦 Tool 2: `bridge monitor`

Real-time updates for link and VLAN changes:

```bash
sudo bridge monitor all
```

Example output:

```
[LINK] br0 state UP
[VLAN] veth-br1 VLAN 10 added
```

---

## 📂 Tool 3: `bridge fdb show`

View the Forwarding Database (MAC address table):

```bash
bridge fdb show br br0
```

Typical output:

```
33:33:00:00:00:01 dev br0 self permanent
02:42:c0:a8:01:02 dev veth-br1 master br0
```

---

## 📊 Tool 4: Interface Stats

Use `ip` or `/proc` for raw traffic counters:

```bash
ip -s link show br0
cat /proc/net/dev | grep br0
```

---

## 🖼️ Monitoring Topology

```
[ veth-br1 ] --> [ br0 ] --> [ veth-br2 ]
      ^                     ^
      |                     |
 tcpdump / fdb       bridge monitor
```

## ❓ Review Questions

1. What tool shows MAC forwarding entries in a bridge?
2. How do you monitor VLAN changes in real time?
3. What tcpdump flag reveals Ethernet headers?

### ✅ Answers

1. `bridge fdb show`
2. `bridge monitor all`
3. `-e`

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| No traffic seen in tcpdump | Interface not up | `ip link set dev ... up` |
| MAC not visible in FDB | No recent traffic | Generate traffic (e.g., `ping`) |
| VLAN not showing in capture | Improper tagging | Validate with `bridge vlan show` |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Example

In production virtual networks, admins regularly use `tcpdump` and `bridge fdb show` to detect packet loss paths, validate STP convergence, and enforce VLAN correctness.
