# 🧠 Lesson 7: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) on Linux Bridges

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand what STP is and why it's used
- Enable and configure STP on Linux bridges
- Monitor STP status and behavior

---

## 🌲 What is Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)?

STP prevents loops in Layer 2 networks by selectively blocking redundant paths and ensuring a loop-free topology.

### Why STP on Linux Bridges?

In virtualized environments, connecting multiple interfaces or bridges may inadvertently create loops — STP ensures network stability and prevents broadcast storms.

---

## 🧪 Enabling STP on a Linux Bridge

### Default Behavior

STP is **disabled by default** on Linux bridges.

### Enable STP

```bash
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge stp_state 1
```

Or update existing bridge:

```bash
sudo ip link set br0 type bridge stp_state 1
```

### Verify STP Status

```bash
bridge link show
bridge -d -s
```

You can also use:

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/stp_state
```

(1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)

---

## 🔧 Tune STP Timers (Advanced)

```bash
# Set bridge hello time (default 2 sec)
echo 4 | sudo tee /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/hello_time

# Set max age (default 20 sec)
echo 30 | sudo tee /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/max_age

# Set forward delay (default 15 sec)
echo 10 | sudo tee /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/forward_delay
```

> Use these only if you understand the implications — changing STP timers can affect convergence and network stability.

## 🖼️ Diagram: STP Behavior

```
[br0] <---> [br1]   # Loop!
  |           |
[eth1]     [eth2]

# With STP:
One link is logically blocked to prevent looping
```

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Simulate a Loop

### Setup

- Create two bridges: `br0`, `br1`
- Connect them using veth pairs
- Enable STP on both bridges

```bash
# Create bridges
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge stp_state 1
sudo ip link add name br1 type bridge stp_state 1

# Create veth pair
sudo ip link add veth-br0 type veth peer name veth-br1

# Connect ends to bridges
sudo ip link set veth-br0 master br0
sudo ip link set veth-br1 master br1
sudo ip link set veth-br0 up
sudo ip link set veth-br1 up
```

### Observe STP Behavior

```bash
bridge link show
cat /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/bridge_id
```

> STP will automatically block one port to prevent loops.

## ❓ Review Questions

1. Why is STP important in bridge networks?
2. How do you enable STP on an existing bridge?
3. What command shows if STP is enabled?

### ✅ Answers

1. To prevent loops and broadcast storms in Layer 2 networks
2. `sudo ip link set br0 type bridge stp_state 1`
3. `cat /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/stp_state` or `bridge -d -s`

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Traffic storm | Loop created without STP | Enable STP on all Linux bridges |
| STP has no effect | Interfaces not up | Ensure all connected interfaces are up |
| Bridge slow to forward | STP delay | Tune forward_delay if needed |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Example

In nested virtualization labs or container networks with multiple bridges, enabling STP ensures stability and avoids the risk of self-inflicted network outages due to loops.
