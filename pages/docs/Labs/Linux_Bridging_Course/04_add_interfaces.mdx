# 🧠 Lesson 4: Adding Interfaces to a Linux Bridge

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Add physical or virtual interfaces to a Linux bridge
- Manage interface states and ensure proper connectivity
- Understand interface role in traffic forwarding

---

## 🔗 Adding Interfaces to a Bridge

### Basic Syntax

```bash
sudo ip link set eth1 master br0
```

> This command assigns `eth1` to the bridge `br0`.

### Multiple Interfaces

```bash
sudo ip link set eth1 master br0
sudo ip link set eth2 master br0
```

### Bring Interfaces Up

```bash
sudo ip link set eth1 up
sudo ip link set eth2 up
```

### Verify Bridge Membership

```bash
bridge link show
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The interface must be **down** before assigning it to a bridge.
- Do not assign an IP address directly to bridge member interfaces.
- Assign IP to the **bridge device** (`br0`) instead.

### Assigning IP to Bridge

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev br0
sudo ip link set br0 up
```

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Add Interfaces to a Bridge

### Assumptions

- Bridge `br0` is already created
- Interfaces `eth1` and `eth2` are available (can be virtual)

```bash
# Add interfaces to bridge
sudo ip link set eth1 down
sudo ip link set eth2 down
sudo ip link set eth1 master br0
sudo ip link set eth2 master br0
sudo ip link set eth1 up
sudo ip link set eth2 up

# Assign IP to bridge, not interfaces
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev br0
sudo ip link set br0 up

# Verify
bridge link
ip addr show br0
```

## 🖼️ Network Topology Diagram (ASCII)

```
[ eth1 ]         [ eth2 ]
     \             /
      \           /
     [ br0 - Linux Bridge ]
               |
         [ IP: 192.168.1.100 ]
```

## ❓ Review Questions

1. Can you assign an IP to a bridge member interface?
2. What must be done before adding an interface to a bridge?
3. How do you confirm which interfaces belong to a bridge?

### ✅ Answers

1. ❌ No — assign it to the bridge device
2. Bring the interface down first
3. `bridge link show`

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| `RTNETLINK: Device busy` | Interface still up | Bring it down before assigning |
| IP not reachable | IP assigned to slave instead of bridge | Assign IP to `br0` only |
| Bridge not forwarding | Interfaces not up | Ensure interfaces are up with `ip link` |

## 🌐 Real-World Example

For containerized applications using LXC or Docker with `--network=bridge`, adding a veth pair to a bridge connects containers to the outside world.
