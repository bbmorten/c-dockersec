# proc/pid/status

Here’s what each line in that `/proc/30215/status` snippet means, and how to read the hex masks into actual capability names:

```text
Uid:    0       0       0       0
Gid:    0       0       0       0
Groups: 0
CapInh: 0000000000000000
CapPrm: 00000000a80425fb
CapEff: 00000000a80425fb
CapBnd: 00000000a80425fb
CapAmb: 0000000000000000
```

| Field      | Meaning                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Uid**    | real, effective, saved-set, **filesystem** UIDs (all `0` → **root**) |
| **Gid**    | real, effective, saved-set, filesystem GIDs (all `0` → **root**)     |
| **Groups** | supplementary (secondary) group IDs (only `0` → the root group)      |

The next lines are [Linux capability sets](./linux-capability-sets.mdx), each shown as a 64-bit hex mask:

* **CapInh**: capabilities **inherited** across an `execve()`.
* **CapPrm**: **permitted** capabilities—the superset this process may make effective.
* **CapEff**: **effective** capabilities—those currently in force.
* **CapBnd**: **bounding** set—the outer limit that can’t be added to permitted.
* **CapAmb**: **ambient** capabilities—automatically kept across `execve()` if in both the inheritable and permitted sets.

Here, only the **Prm**, **Eff**, and **Bnd** sets are non-zero (`0xA80425FB`). Decoding that mask gives the following capabilities enabled in all three sets:

```
CAP_CHOWN              (bit  0)
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE       (bit  1)
CAP_FOWNER             (bit  3)
CAP_FSETID             (bit  4)
CAP_KILL               (bit  5)
CAP_SETGID             (bit  6)
CAP_SETUID             (bit  7)
CAP_SETPCAP            (bit  8)
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE   (bit 10)
CAP_NET_RAW            (bit 13)
CAP_SYS_CHROOT         (bit 18)
CAP_MKNOD              (bit 27)
CAP_AUDIT_WRITE        (bit 29)
CAP_SETFCAP            (bit 31)
```

* **CapInh = 0**: it won’t inherit any extra capabilities on exec.
* **CapAmb = 0**: no ambient capabilities are in play (these are rarely used).

### In plain English

1. **This process is running as root** (UID=0/GID=0), with no additional Linux groups.
2. **It holds a broad set of capabilities**—notably the ability to change ownership on files, override DAC checks, bind low-numbered ports, perform raw network I/O, enter chroots, and more.
3. Because its **bounding set** equals its **permitted set**, it can’t raise itself to any capability it doesn’t already hold.
4. Since **inheritable** and **ambient** are zero, children of this process (via `exec`) won’t automatically pick up capabilities beyond the standard behavior for a root-owned process.

In effect, it’s a fully “powered” root process, but written in the finer-grained Linux capability model rather than the old all-or-nothing root model.
