# 🧠 Lesson 9: Security and Isolation for Linux Bridges

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify security risks associated with Linux bridges
- Apply best practices to secure bridge-based networking
- Implement basic network isolation strategies

---

## 🛡️ Why Bridge Security Matters

Since Linux bridges operate at Layer 2, they're vulnerable to:

- **MAC flooding**
- **ARP spoofing**
- **Traffic sniffing** across shared broadcast domains

Bridges used in virtualization expose VMs and containers to lateral movement unless properly secured.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. Use ebtables or nftables to Filter Layer 2 Traffic

```bash
# Drop all non-IP traffic
sudo ebtables -A FORWARD -p ! IPv4 -j DROP
```

### 2. Disable Promiscuous Mode (unless needed)

```bash
sudo ip link set br0 promisc off
```

### 3. Isolate VLANs on the Bridge

Use `bridge vlan` filtering to segregate tenants or workloads.

```bash
# Assign eth1 to VLAN 10 on br0
bridge vlan add dev eth1 vid 10 pvid untagged master
```

### 4. Limit Bridge Interfaces with Access Rules

Use `iptables` or `nftables` to control traffic entering/exiting bridge interfaces.

```bash
# Example nftables rule
nft add rule inet filter forward iifname "br0" ip daddr 10.0.0.0/8 drop
```

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Secure a Bridge with ebtables and VLAN

### Step 1: Block ARP spoofing

```bash
sudo ebtables -A FORWARD -p ARP --arp-opcode Reply -j DROP
```

### Step 2: Assign VLAN and test

```bash
# Add VLAN filtering on eth2
bridge vlan add dev eth2 vid 20 pvid untagged master
bridge vlan show
```

> Use `tcpdump -i br0` to validate ARP is blocked and traffic is filtered.

## 🖼️ Diagram: Isolated VLANs with One Bridge

```
[ eth1 (VLAN 10) ]
        
       [ br0 ] --- [ eth2 (VLAN 20) ]
       /     \
 [VM1-veth] [VM2-veth]
```

## ❓ Review Questions

1. Name one tool to control Layer 2 filtering on a bridge.
2. Why should VLANs be used with bridges?
3. What command disables promiscuous mode?

### ✅ Answers

1. `ebtables` or `nftables`
2. To enforce isolation across different tenants or services
3. `ip link set br0 promisc off`

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Containers can sniff each other's traffic | No isolation | Implement VLAN filtering or namespace isolation |
| VLAN not applied | Interface not part of bridge or misconfigured | Check with `bridge vlan show` |
| Bridge accepts spoofed ARP | No Layer 2 filtering | Use `ebtables` rules to block ARP replies |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Example

In a multi-tenant KVM cloud or a Docker lab, configuring VLANs and applying `ebtables` filters prevents tenants from intercepting or spoofing each other’s traffic.
