# `containerd-shim threads` in `pstree` Output Explained




The `11*[{containerd-shim}]` notation in the `pstree` output means:

> ðŸ”¹ **`containerd-shim` has 11 kernel threads (or lightweight threads), shown as `{containerd-shim}` processes, and they are being grouped/hidden in the tree view for brevity.**

---

### ðŸ§  What Does `{process}` Mean?

In `pstree`:

* Entries wrapped in `{}` (e.g., `{containerd-shim}`) represent **threads**, not full-blown processes.
* These threads are part of the main process (in this case, `containerd-shim`) and share the same PID in the kernel's task group.

---

### ðŸ§© Why 11 Threads?

* `containerd-shim` uses multiple **goroutines** internally (it's written in Go), and Go schedules these on kernel threads (via `runtime.LockOSThread`).
* Some of these threads are:

  * I/O handlers (pipes for containerâ€™s stdout/stderr)
  * Signal handlers
  * Reaper for the child process
  * Timer and epoll loops

---

### ðŸ“˜ Example Breakdown

This line:

```bash
containerd-shimâ”€â”¬â”€sleep
                â””â”€11*[{containerd-shim}]
```

means:

* `containerd-shim` is running and managing the `sleep` process.
* It has **11 kernel threads** currently active.
* `pstree` hides them by default as `11*[{...}]`. You can see them in detail with `ps` or by disabling thread grouping.

---

### ðŸ”Ž How to See These Threads Individually

To expand and list these threads:

```bash
ps -T -p <PID-of-containerd-shim>
```

Example:

```bash
ps -T -p 65605
```

This will show something like:

```
  PID  SPID TTY      TIME     CMD
65605 65605 ?        00:00:00 containerd-shim
65605 65606 ?        00:00:00 containerd-shim
65605 65607 ?        00:00:00 containerd-shim
...
```

* `SPID` = **thread ID**
* All threads belong to the same process (`PID`)
