# 🧠 Lesson 6: Bridging with Virtual Machines and Containers

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Set up Linux bridges for use with virtual machines and containers
- Understand different networking modes for KVM/libvirt, Docker, Podman, and LXC
- Connect virtual NICs to bridges to provide network access

## 🧱 Bridging with Virtual Machines (KVM / QEMU / Libvirt)

### 🔧 Libvirt Bridge Setup

Libvirt typically uses `virbr0` for NAT. To use a Linux bridge for full external access:

#### Step 1: Create a persistent bridge via Netplan

```yaml
# /etc/netplan/01-bridge.yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces: [eth0]
      dhcp4: true
```

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

#### Step 2: Configure in `virt-manager`

- Open VM settings → Network
- Change interface to **Bridge br0**
- Device model: virtio (optional)

---

## 🐳 Docker Bridge Integration

Docker uses `docker0` bridge by default. To use a custom bridge:

### Step-by-Step

```bash
# Create a custom bridge
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set dev br0 up

# Connect container to it with custom networking
docker network create \
  --driver=bridge \
  --subnet=192.168.50.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.50.1 \
  -o "com.docker.network.bridge.name"="br0" \
  br0net

# Run container
docker run -it --rm --network=br0net alpine sh
```

---

## ⚙️ Podman + Network Bridge

### Using CNI Plugins (default)

Podman uses **CNI** under the hood:

```bash
# List networks
podman network ls

# Create new bridge network
podman network create --subnet 10.89.0.0/24 mybr

# Run container with custom bridge
podman run -it --rm --network=mybr alpine
```

---

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Bridge with KVM and Docker

### 1. KVM VM Network Setup

- Install: `sudo apt install virt-manager qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system`
- Create a Linux bridge as shown
- Launch VM and attach NIC to bridge
- Ping gateway or another VM on same bridge

### 2. Docker Custom Bridge

- Follow Docker steps above to create and connect to custom bridge
- Inspect with `docker network inspect br0net`

## ❓ Review Questions

1. What is the default Docker bridge called?
2. How do you attach a KVM VM to a custom Linux bridge?
3. What command lists Podman networks?

### ✅ Answers

1. `docker0`
2. Set NIC to use `br0` in virt-manager or XML config
3. `podman network ls`

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| VM has no internet | Bridge not connected to uplink | Add physical NIC to bridge |
| Container can't ping | Wrong subnet or missing IP | Check bridge IP and routing |
| Bridge not visible | Not set up or not up | `ip link set br0 up` |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Example

On a developer workstation, you can run multiple containers and VMs sharing the same bridge. This allows integration testing across tools like nginx (in a container) and PostgreSQL (in a VM).
