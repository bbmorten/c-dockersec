# 🧠 Lesson 5: Connectivity Testing and Traffic Flow

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Verify traffic flow across bridged interfaces
- Test connectivity using common tools
- Use packet capture tools for deeper inspection

---

## 🔎 Why Test Bridge Connectivity?

Testing ensures that interfaces added to a bridge can communicate as if they were on the same physical network — with proper MAC learning and frame forwarding.

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Basic Connectivity Test

### Prerequisites

- Bridge `br0` exists
- At least two interfaces (e.g., `eth1`, `eth2`) are connected to `br0`
- Use VMs or namespaces to simulate multiple hosts

### Step-by-Step

```bash
# Check current bridge connections
bridge link

# Assign IP to bridge (if not done yet)
sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.1/24 dev br0
sudo ip link set br0 up

# (Optional) Create network namespaces to simulate two hosts
sudo ip netns add ns1
sudo ip netns add ns2

# Create veth pair for ns1 and bridge
sudo ip link add veth-ns1 type veth peer name veth-br1
sudo ip link set veth-ns1 netns ns1
sudo ip link set veth-br1 master br0
sudo ip link set veth-br1 up

# Assign IP inside ns1 and bring up
sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip addr add 192.168.100.101/24 dev veth-ns1
sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set veth-ns1 up
sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link set lo up

# Repeat for ns2
sudo ip link add veth-ns2 type veth peer name veth-br2
sudo ip link set veth-ns2 netns ns2
sudo ip link set veth-br2 master br0
sudo ip link set veth-br2 up

sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip addr add 192.168.100.102/24 dev veth-ns2
sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip link set veth-ns2 up
sudo ip netns exec ns2 ip link set lo up

# Test ping from ns1 to ns2
sudo ip netns exec ns1 ping -c 4 192.168.100.102
```

## 📦 Tools for Testing

### 1. `ping`

Basic ICMP test to check L3 connectivity.

### 2. `arp` / `ip neigh`

Validate MAC address resolution.

```bash
ip neigh show
```

### 3. `bridge monitor`

Real-time events for bridge devices.

```bash
sudo bridge monitor all
```

### 4. `tcpdump`

Capture packets to confirm traffic is flowing through bridge.

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i br0
```

## 🖼️ Diagram: Namespaces and Bridge

```
[ns1: 192.168.100.101] <---> [br0] <---> [ns2: 192.168.100.102]
       |                         |              |
    veth-ns1               veth-br1         veth-ns2
```

## ❓ Review Questions

1. What tool can you use to view real-time bridge events?
2. How can you test MAC address learning on a bridge?
3. What does `tcpdump -i br0` do?

### ✅ Answers

1. `bridge monitor all`
2. Use `ping` then check `ip neigh` or `bridge fdb show`
3. Captures all packets on the bridge interface

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Ping fails | Interfaces not up | `ip link set ... up` |
| No traffic | veth pairs not connected to bridge | Verify with `bridge link` |
| MAC not resolved | ARP failure | Check `ip neigh` and interface configs |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Example

You can use `tcpdump -i br0` on a Linux bridge connected to KVM guests to inspect inter-VM traffic. This is helpful for debugging firewall rules or performance issues.
