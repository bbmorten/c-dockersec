# Secure Docker Compose with TLS + Secrets

Here’s a **hardened `docker-compose.yml` example** that securely injects:

1. ✅ **TLS certificates** (via bind mount)
2. ✅ **Secrets** (via `secrets:` in Compose)

This is suitable for services like HTTPS web apps or APIs that need credentials or TLS keys at runtime.

## 🔐 **Secure Docker Compose with TLS + Secrets**

Assumes:

* App uses TLS (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`)
* App expects certs at `/tls/` and a secret token via environment
* Non-root user (`1001:1001`)
* Docker Compose version `3.7+`

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  secureapp:
    image: my-secure-app:latest
    container_name: tls_app
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    user: "1001:1001"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Mount TLS certs read-only
    volumes:
      - ./certs:/tls:ro

    # Inject secret at runtime
    secrets:
      - api_token

    environment:
      TLS_CERT_FILE: /tls/cert.pem
      TLS_KEY_FILE: /tls/key.pem
      API_TOKEN_FILE: /run/secrets/api_token

    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-k", "https://localhost/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3

secrets:
  api_token:
    file: ./secrets/api_token.txt
```

## 📁 Project Directory Structure Example

```
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── certs/
│   ├── cert.pem
│   └── key.pem
└── secrets/
    └── api_token.txt
```

## ✅ Good Practices

| Security Feature    | Method                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| TLS certs read-only | `volumes: ./certs:/tls:ro`                   |
| Runtime secrets     | `secrets:` + `API_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/…` |
| Read-only FS        | `read_only: true`                            |
| Drop capabilities   | `cap_drop: - ALL`                            |
| Ephemeral /tmp      | `tmpfs: - /tmp`                              |
| No privilege gain   | `security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true`     |
