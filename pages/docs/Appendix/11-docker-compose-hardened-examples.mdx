# Docker Compose Hardened Examples

Here are **hardened `docker-compose.yml` files** for:

1. âœ… **Python app**
2. âœ… **Alpine-based shell app**

Both apply security best practices: read-only filesystem, dropped capabilities, no privilege escalation, tmpfs mount, and non-root users.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Hardened Docker Compose for Python App

Assumes:

* Python app listens on port 8000
* App is built from a secure Dockerfile like `python:3.12-slim`
* Non-root user `pythonuser` (UID `1001`) is created in the Dockerfile

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  pythonapp:
    image: my-secure-python-app:latest
    container_name: secure_python
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    user: "1001:1001"  # Matches USER in Dockerfile
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"
      ENVIRONMENT: production
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
```

## ðŸ”¸ 2. Hardened Docker Compose for Alpine Shell App

Assumes:

* Simple shell script binary app (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/app`)
* Non-root user `secureuser` with UID `1001`

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  shellapp:
    image: my-secure-alpine-app:latest
    container_name: secure_shell
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    user: "1001:1001"
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["/usr/local/bin/app", "--health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
```
