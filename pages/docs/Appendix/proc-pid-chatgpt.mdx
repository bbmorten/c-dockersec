**In practice**, you’ll most often poke at:

* `/proc/<PID>/cmdline`, `/status` or `/stat` to see what it is and who owns it
* `/proc/<PID>/fd/` to inspect open files/sockets
* `/proc/<PID>/ns/` to figure out which namespaces it lives in
* `/proc/<PID>/limits` to check resource caps
* `/proc/<PID>/smaps` or `/statm` for memory usage details

But now you have the full catalog—you can explore pretty much anything about a live process via these virtual files!
