# 🧠 Lesson 3: Creating and Managing Linux Bridges

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create and inspect Linux bridges using `ip` and `bridge` commands
- Manage bridge lifecycle (create, delete, enable, disable)
- Understand basic bridge properties

## 🛠️ Creating a Linux Bridge

Linux bridges are created using modern tools: `ip` and `bridge`. Avoid using the deprecated `brctl`.

### 🔧 Create a New Bridge Interface

```bash
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
```

### 🚀 Bring the Bridge Interface Up

```bash
sudo ip link set dev br0 up
```

### 🧼 Delete a Bridge

```bash
sudo ip link delete br0 type bridge
```

---

## 🔍 Inspecting a Linux Bridge

### List All Interfaces

```bash
ip link show
```

### Check Bridge Status

```bash
bridge link show
bridge vlan
bridge -s
```

### View Bridge Interface Details

```bash
ip addr show br0
```

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Create and Inspect a Bridge

### Step-by-Step on Ubuntu 24.04

```bash
# Install tools (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iproute2 bridge-utils -y

# Create bridge
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge

# Bring it up
sudo ip link set br0 up

# Inspect bridge
ip link show br0
bridge link
bridge vlan

# Clean up
sudo ip link delete br0 type bridge
```

### 💡 Optional: Persistent Bridge (via Netplan)

Create `/etc/netplan/01-bridge.yaml`:

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  bridges:
    br0:
      dhcp4: yes
      interfaces: [eth0]
```

Then apply it:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

---

## 🖼️ Conceptual Diagram (ASCII)

```
[ eth0 ]        [ eth1 ]
    |               |
    |               |
     \             /
      [ br0 - Linux Bridge ]
```

## ❓ Review Questions

1. What command creates a bridge named `br0`?
2. How do you check which interfaces are part of a bridge?
3. What file do you edit to make a bridge persistent with Netplan?

### ✅ Answers

1. `sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge`
2. `bridge link`
3. `/etc/netplan/01-bridge.yaml`

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Bridge doesn’t show up | Not brought up | `sudo ip link set br0 up` |
| Deleted by reboot | Not configured persistently | Use Netplan or systemd-networkd |
| Bridge doesn’t pass traffic | No interfaces added | See next lesson on adding interfaces |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Example

On a virtualization server using **libvirt**, creating a `br0` bridge and adding `eth0` to it allows VMs to share the host’s NIC as if they were directly plugged into the network.
