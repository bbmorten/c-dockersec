# Lab 2: Exploring Process Relationships in Containers (Ubuntu 24.04 Guide)

## Objective
Understand and visualize the relationship between process IDs (PIDs) on the host, container engine, runtime, and inside the container using tools like `pstree`, `ps`, and `nsenter`.

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 24.04 system (VM or bare metal)
- Docker Engine installed (`sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io -y`)
- `pstree` installed (`sudo apt install psmisc -y`)
- `nsenter` installed (`sudo apt install util-linux -y`)

## Lab Steps

1. **Start a Test Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name proc-demo ubuntu:24.04 sleep 3000
   # From a private registry
   docker run -d --name proc-demo 192.168.48.42:5000/ubuntu:24.04 sleep 3000
   ```

2. **Find the Container's PID on the Host**
   - Get the container's main process PID as seen by the host:
     ```bash
     docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' proc-demo
     export CONTAINER_PID=$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' proc-demo)
     ```
   - Note this PID (e.g., 12345).

3. **Visualize the Process Tree**
   - Use `pstree` to see the relationship between Docker, containerd, runc, and the container process:
     ```bash
     sudo pstree -s -p ${CONTAINER_PID}
     ```
   - Look for a hierarchy like: [Process Tree Example](../Examples/pstree-container-pid.mdx)
     ```
     systemd(1)-+-containerd-shim(PID3)-+-sleep(12345)
     ```




4. **Explore the Container's Process Namespace**
   - Use `nsenter` to enter the container's PID namespace:
     ```bash
     sudo nsenter -t 12345 -p ps aux
     ```
   - The `sleep` process will appear as PID 1 inside the container, even though it has a different PID on the host.

5. **Compare Process Listings**
   - On the host:
     ```bash
     ps -ef | grep sleep
     ```
   - Inside the container:
     ```bash
     docker exec proc-demo ps -ef
     ```
   - Observe the PID differences and the isolated process tree.

6. **(Optional) Explore with Other Runtimes**
   - If using rootless Docker, containerd, or gVisor/Kata, repeat the above steps and note any differences in the process tree or PID mapping.

## Deliverable
Submit screenshots or command outputs showing:
- The process tree from the host
- The PID mapping between host and container
- The process listing inside the container
- A brief explanation of the relationship between host and container PIDs
