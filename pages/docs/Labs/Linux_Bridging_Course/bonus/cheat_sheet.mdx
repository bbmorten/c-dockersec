# 🧾 Bonus: Linux Bridge Command Cheat Sheet

## 🛠️ Bridge Lifecycle

```bash
# Create a new bridge
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge

# Delete a bridge
sudo ip link delete br0 type bridge

# Bring bridge up/down
sudo ip link set dev br0 up
sudo ip link set dev br0 down
```

---

## 🔗 Interface Management

```bash
# Add an interface to a bridge
sudo ip link set eth1 master br0

# Remove an interface from a bridge
sudo ip link set eth1 nomaster

# Show interfaces and bridge links
ip link show
bridge link
```

---

## 📶 Address and Routing

```bash
# Assign an IP address to the bridge
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev br0

# View bridge IP config
ip addr show br0
```

---

## 🌲 Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

```bash
# Enable STP
sudo ip link set br0 type bridge stp_state 1

# View STP state
cat /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/stp_state
bridge -d -s
```

---

## 🧵 VLAN Filtering

```bash
# Enable VLAN filtering on bridge
sudo ip link add br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1

# Add interface to VLAN
bridge vlan add dev eth1 vid 10 pvid untagged master

# Show VLAN table
bridge vlan show
```

---

## 📡 Monitoring & Debugging

```bash
# View MAC forwarding table
bridge fdb show

# Monitor live bridge events
sudo bridge monitor all

# Capture traffic on bridge
sudo tcpdump -i br0 -nn -e
```

---

## 🔒 Security

```bash
# Drop all non-IP traffic
sudo ebtables -A FORWARD -p ! IPv4 -j DROP

# Block ARP replies (anti-spoofing)
sudo ebtables -A FORWARD -p ARP --arp-opcode Reply -j DROP

# Disable promiscuous mode
sudo ip link set br0 promisc off
```

---

## 🚀 Performance & Tuning

```bash
# Set MTU
sudo ip link set dev br0 mtu 1500

# Disable offloads for benchmarking
sudo ethtool -K eth0 gro off gso off tso off

# Enable fair queueing (latency optimization)
sudo tc qdisc add dev br0 root fq
```
