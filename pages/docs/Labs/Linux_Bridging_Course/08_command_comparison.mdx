# 🧠 Lesson 8: Command Comparison – `ip` vs `bridge` vs `brctl`

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the differences between legacy and modern Linux bridge tools
- Use modern `ip` and `bridge` commands for all management tasks
- Recognize deprecated usage and migration strategies

## 🛠️ Overview of Tools

| Tool     | Status       | Purpose                          | Recommended? |
|----------|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| `brctl`  | Deprecated   | Legacy bridge utility            | ❌ No         |
| `ip`     | Modern       | General networking tool          | ✅ Yes        |
| `bridge` | Modern       | Bridge-specific management       | ✅ Yes        |

> 📌 The `bridge` command is a sub-tool in the `iproute2` suite, focusing solely on bridge control.

## 🔍 Command Equivalents

| Task                        | `brctl`                      | `ip` / `bridge`                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Create bridge               | `brctl addbr br0`            | `ip link add name br0 type bridge`                   |
| Delete bridge               | `brctl delbr br0`            | `ip link delete br0 type bridge`                     |
| Add interface to bridge     | `brctl addif br0 eth1`       | `ip link set eth1 master br0`                        |
| Remove interface from bridge| `brctl delif br0 eth1`       | `ip link set eth1 nomaster`                          |
| Show bridges                | `brctl show`                 | `bridge link` or `bridge vlan`                       |
| Enable STP                  | `brctl stp br0 on`           | `ip link set br0 type bridge stp_state 1`            |

## 🧪 Hands-on Lab: Convert brctl to ip/bridge

### 1. Legacy `brctl` approach

```bash
# Legacy (do not use in production)
sudo brctl addbr br0
sudo brctl addif br0 eth1
sudo ip link set br0 up
```

### 2. Modern `ip` + `bridge`

```bash
# Modern approach
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set eth1 master br0
sudo ip link set br0 up
```

### View bridge status

```bash
bridge link
bridge vlan
```

## ❓ Review Questions

1. Which tool is deprecated: `brctl`, `ip`, or `bridge`?
2. How do you assign an interface to a bridge using modern commands?
3. What is the command to view all bridge ports?

### ✅ Answers

1. `brctl`
2. `ip link set ethX master br0`
3. `bridge link`

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|--------|--------|-----|
| `brctl` command not found | Not installed or deprecated | Use `ip` and `bridge` instead |
| Interface not assigned | Command syntax issue | Use `ip link set <iface> master <bridge>` |
| Bridge not visible | Not created | Verify with `ip link show` |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Example

Migrating older KVM deployments from `brctl`-based scripts to `ip`/`bridge` improves compatibility and long-term maintainability across modern Linux systems like Ubuntu 24.04.
